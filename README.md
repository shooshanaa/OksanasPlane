Plane Seat Allocation System

This is considered to be SDA Group task. During pair coding the following idea was implemented.
Based on the ticket type (business or economy) the passenger is being redirected whether to Business or Economy Menu.
In both menus following methods were applied -
* check available seats
* book a seat
* get a random seat.

Later passenger's name and allocated seat are stored in two different files - BusinessPassengers.txt and EconomyPassengers.txt.
